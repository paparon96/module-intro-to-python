    "x = (\"foo\", 1)\n",

    "Lists can be used most places that a tuple is used, so it can be confusing what the difference is between the two. Besides technical differences that we won't go in to here, the following rules can help you decide when to use a tuple and when to use a list: \n",

    "```python\n",
    "name,num = x\n",
    "```\n",
